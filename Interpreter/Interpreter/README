    example: java Main "C:\Users\user\Desktop\test.txt" "C:\Users\user\Desktop\data.txt"
    
To run with test program 1:
    
    java Main "test program1" "test data1"

To run with test program 2:

    java Main "test program2" "test data2"
    
====================================================================

To run from Eclipse:
    Import project into Eclipse, run, then type in file paths for the test
    program and data, when prompted. 
        
        example: to run test program1, type in:
            Z:\workspace\Interpreter\src\test program1
        and then:
            Z:\workspace\Interpreter\src\test data1
