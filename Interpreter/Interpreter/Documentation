    The Interpreter package contains:
        Main class: The Main class for the package. It is repsonsible
        for reading in files and calling methods from the other two
        classes.
        Tokenizer: The tokenizer for the project. It takes in a file and outputs
        a LinkedList of valid CORE tokens.
        ParsePrintExecute: This contains all classes (nodes) for the Object-
        Oriented Parse Tree. It Parses a LinkedList of tokens into an abstract
        parse tree, prints them out, and executes the CORE program.
=======================================================================
To run from command line: navigate to *\Interpreter\bin and type:

    java Main "file path 1" "file path 2"
    
    example: java Main "C:\Users\user\Desktop\test.txt" "C:\Users\user\Desktop\data.txt"
    
To run with test program 1:
    
    java Main "test program1" "test data1"

To run with test program 2:

    java Main "test program2" "test data2"
    
====================================================================

To run from Eclipse:
    Import project into Eclipse, run, then type in file paths for the test
    program and data, when prompted. 
        
        example: to run test program1, type in:
            Z:\workspace\Interpreter\src\test program1
        and then:
            Z:\workspace\Interpreter\src\test data1
========================================================================
Testing:
    The Parse section was tested by changing the test programs to various
    CORE programs, and ensuring they either parsed the correct programs or
    rejected the incorrect ones. The Print section was tested alongside the
    Parser to ensure it was parsing correctly.
    The Execute section was tested using the three given test programs. All
    three work correctly.
    
    There are no known bugs.
